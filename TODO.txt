NewInvoiceView -> openNextView to be set to /invoices/[newInvoiceId]
    Maybe needs to invalidate SWR cached data

Same as above on NewPatientView

On ListTable, action button click catched by row 'onClickAction': <Link> sovrapposti

Login page doesn't uses light theme

Peek theme from system

Push down alongside the DOM, my hooks (useInvoices...): fetch data where needed,
and manage loading and error state in an easier way!
Don't pass data manager functions as props, but import from lib folder!



Reducers and context:
    - data loading inside useEffect() of dashbaord component, firing 'load' action(s)
    - data mix:
        - fatturatoUltimoAnno: extract from patient and use a state for dashboard; use hook 'useMemo'
        to avoid regenerating the array on each render
        - patient.ultimaModifica: reload data on mutation??

Maybe reducers should even not be used. Use swr instead.

SWR:
    - useInvoices, usePatients... on even component
    - fatturatoUltimoAnno: depends on invoices and patients, so use useMemo to calculate it. If there
    is no change between page navigation, preceiding values are used.
    - on useInvoices, don't sort invoices: send correct server request
    - options:
        - revalidateOnFocus: not needed, there won't be any change between screen lock and unlock



Check if useMemo is needed in MUI tables, specially for items sorting.
